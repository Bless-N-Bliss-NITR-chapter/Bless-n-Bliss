                  Childhood is a time to learn, have fun, with joy and wonder.
                  Kids at BnB education centre need to do all of that too. BnB
                  makes sure the children get the right exposure to things, team
                  Ranchi has made a point of taking the children at ECs in
                  Ranchi for Science City visits every once in a while.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The children get to see the amazing things there and learn the
                  scientific explanations behind it. This sort of becomes
                  educational and enjoyable at the same time for the children
                  and fuels their curiosity. BnB will continue to encourage
                  students with visits like this in the future.

                  The Bless N Bliss club organised a self defence training
                  programme under the name of “Project Saksham” for girls in our
                  campus premises on 26th, 27th October 2019 in three different
                  sessions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We proudly announce that the project was successfully c
                  ompleted as more than 200 girls participated and learnt many
                  different types of self-defence techniques that would help
                  them at any moment of their life when they will be in trouble.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A lot of positive feedbacks were recieved by our dedicated
                  members and participants were heard saying that they were
                  grateful for they felt like they were prepared to conquer.
                  Motivation of our team was enhanced to a great extent as we
                  received appreciation from institute authorities for
                  organising activities that took a step forward in making girls
                  self-sufficient. B’n’B is always committed to help the needy,

                  "Bless N Bliss @ROOTS 3.0" March 16, 2019Bless N Bliss Bless N
                  Bliss collaborated with the creative conclave of NITR, Roots
                  3.0 as a social partner. Bless N Bliss, the brainchild of
                  Md.Akrammudin Ansari an alumnus of NITR has successfully
                  established itself as an engine for betterment of society.
                  This collaboration was solely aimed at getting the message
                  through to the NITR junta regarding various projects that are
                  currently underway at its helm.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We had two events lined up on 8th and 9th March. One wa s a
                  talk on social entrepreneurship by Mr. Akram Ansari during the
                  opening of the ceremony of Roots 3.0. This event was attended
                  by various dignitaries of NITR including the director, dean
                  and president SAC. Mr. Akram elaborated on the kind of
                  activities he undertook, his motivation to do so and how he
                  has sustained it through all these years. He stressed upon the
                  financial as well as motivational aspect of social
                  entrepreneurship. He urged the crowd present out there to
                  remain confident, caring and energetic in their endeavors. He
                  also outlined the importance of the fact “giving back to the
                  society” in some way or the other. Then there was a question
                  answer session where he took up some queries of the people
                  present there. His session was very well received and Bless N
                  Bliss was applauded for its work towards a noble goal. This
                  was followed by the lumeire event organised by cinematics
                  where many short films were screened much to the delight of
                  the crowd out there.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The second event was that of Ms.Meera Parida, one of the most
                  influential transgender personalities of Odisha. Among the
                  host of her achievements includes representing INDIA in USA
                  San diego for a worldwide transgender conclave. She currently
                  works for the upliftment of the transgender community through
                  her organization, SAKHA. She talked upon the lines of
                  socio-economic condition of the transgender community. She
                  outlined her journey from “Maydhar to Meera”. Her journey was
                  grueling. At one point of life she was raped while working as
                  a construction worker. But her bull headed stance to do
                  something for her community drove her to establish the
                  organization. She even owns a successful business whose
                  proceeds go into helping the transgender community. She
                  pressed upon the need for political and social will to bring
                  the community out of penury. She also urged the educated
                  community to be more sensitive towards the need of the
                  downtrodden and pitch in with their contribution. Her words
                  were capable of evoking the most extreme emotions and
                  encouraged the listeners to do something for their fellow
                  brethren. As a group of social workers we at Bless N Bliss are
                  really grateful to the speakers, the NITR junta, ROOTS team
                  for their support towards our cause.

                  amenities to the needy. With this belief, the donation drive
                  was started on 16th July 2019 at Jain University. Students of
                  the Jain University were very generous towards this noble
                  cause, showed continuous support through both the phases of
                  donation drive, contributing significantly. All the
                  collections will be donated and be put to good use by the
                  organisation at the end of the donation drive. Special thanks
                  to Taniya Gope, Ankitha Sarji, Nimisha Santhosh, Apoorva
                  Manaswini T, Chandana G, Ujjwal Jain, Lokesh jain, Mir Mohamed
                  Ali and Prithivi Reddy for their hard work and sincere efforts
                  in conducting this donation drive. Kudos to the team! Here are
                  few pics during 2nd set of collection..
